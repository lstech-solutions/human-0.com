_Last updated: November 28, 2025 ([view history](https://github.com/lstech-solutions/human-0.com/commits/main/apps/docs/terms.md))_

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of **HUMΛN-Ø** (the "Service"), including any websites, web applications, APIs, or related services.

The Service is developed and operated by **LSTS SAS** ("LSTS", "we", "us", "our"), a company incorporated in **Medellín, Colombia**.

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. Eligibility

You may use the Service only if you:

- Are legally capable of entering into a binding agreement; and
- Comply with all applicable laws and these Terms.

The Service is not directed to children under the age where they can validly consent to data processing under local law.

## 2. Accounts and authentication

### 2.1 Account creation

Certain features may require an account. When we enable authentication (including **Google login via Supabase**), you agree to:

- Provide accurate and up-to-date information
- Maintain the security of your account and credentials
- Notify us promptly of any unauthorized use or security breach

### 2.2 Third-party authentication (Google / Supabase)

When you log in using **Google** or other identity providers via **Supabase Auth**:

- You authorize us to receive basic profile and authentication information from the provider as described in the **Privacy Policy**
- Your use of third-party services (e.g. Google) is also governed by their own terms and policies

We reserve the right to refuse or revoke access if we detect abuse, security threats, or violations of these Terms.

## 3. Acceptable use

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for any illegal activity or in violation of applicable law
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, or accounts
- Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service

We may suspend or terminate your access if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms.

## 4. Intellectual property

### 4.1 Ownership

Unless otherwise stated, the Service (including software, design, text, graphics, and other content) is owned by **LSTS SAS** or its licensors.

All **monetized functions**, premium services, and related intellectual property are owned and operated by **LSTS SAS**, even when they are made available under open-source or source-available licenses for client-side components.

### 4.2 Open-source components

Parts of the Service may be made available under open-source licenses (for example, portions of the HUMAN-0 codebase on GitHub). Those components are governed by the relevant license terms (e.g. MIT License in the `LICENSE` file of the repository).

These Terms govern your use of the hosted Service, APIs, and any monetized or managed offerings provided by LSTS.

---

## 5. Beta features and changes

The Service is under active development and may include experimental or beta features.

We may, at our discretion and without prior notice:

- Modify or discontinue features
- Introduce new functionality
- Enforce usage limits or quotas

We will try to avoid breaking changes where possible, but **we do not guarantee continuity of any particular feature**.

---

## 6. Fees and monetization

If we introduce paid plans or monetized features:

- Pricing and billing terms will be communicated separately (for example, on a pricing page or in a specific agreement)
- By subscribing or making payments, you agree to the applicable billing and refund policies
- LSTS SAS will be the entity responsible for providing the monetized services

Until then, any use is provided on a preview or evaluation basis, and we may limit or revoke access at any time.

---

## 7. Disclaimers

The Service is provided **"as is" and "as available"**, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to:

- Merchantability
- Fitness for a particular purpose
- Non-infringement
- Availability, reliability, or accuracy of the Service or its outputs

Data and metrics exposed by HUMΛN-Ø (including human population or impact estimates) may be based on external sources and modeling and **should not be treated as official or definitive statistics**.

---

## 8. Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- LSTS SAS and its directors, employees, and affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, or goodwill, arising from your use of the Service.
- Our total aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be limited to the amount you have paid to us for the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or, if you have not paid, to one hundred (100) USD (or equivalent in local currency).

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.

---
